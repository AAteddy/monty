0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
This is a C program that will take a file as an argument, open the file, and read the instructions in the file, line by line.

For each line read, the interpreter is supposed to execute the instructions on that line.

The Monty bytecode is made up of special instructions and each line contains no or just one instruction.
